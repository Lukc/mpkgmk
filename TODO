Core:
	- Configuration reading. None is currently being read.
	- Command Line Interface. None is available at this point.
	- Modules need to receive a simpler structure about the package data, not
	  a whole recipe.
	- Be more careful about the use of parts of the recipe that might not be
	  here.

	- Cleaning. Memory leaks and other similar stuff is frequent.

Parsing:
	- Total rewrite needed.
	- Automated variables substitutions should occur.
	- “Empty” fields (ie. whitespace strings) should not be kept in memory.
	- A Version structure would be better for our versions, but would need
	  to be parsed and an API would be required to work with them.

modules:
	- Lua
	- libarchive + pkgutils
	- libcurl (could be better, with .part files)
	- assemblers
		- libarchive/CRUX/pkgutils
		- pacman, pacman-g2
		- dpkg
		- rpm
	- Recipe readers (package.yaml, package.json, …), plus the infrastructure
	  for them.

build system:
	- Allow disabling modules.
	- Deduplicate the list of files to add in tarballs.
