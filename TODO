Core:
	- Recipe reading… Yes, seriously. There’s currently none.
	  package.yamls are the priority, here.
	- Configuration reading. About as important as recipe-reading.
	  Maybe a mpkgmk.yaml or something would do the trick.
	- Make the configuration a RecipeElement (or whatnot) tree. We’ll need
	  many more options and modules might not want to (or rather I don’t want
	  them to) add stuff to our current Configuration structure.

	- MASSIVE CLEANING (stuff not freed, directories not removed, etc.)
	- Also, there is no configurable packages_directory.

modules:
	- Lua
	- zsh (doesn’t “need” to be done, but we should at least ask for
	  the possibility of using it)
	- libarchive
	- libcurl
	- assemblers
		- libarchive/CRUX is a priority (it’s simple and it makes a good example)
		- pacmen’s. It can be based on the CRUX module and remains pretty simple.
		- dpkg
		- rpm
		note on assemblers: they could be done in Lua or whatnot and not be built ins.
	- Recipe readers (package.yaml, package.json, …)

build system:
	- use one
	- Make it possible to not build modules, although libarchive and
	  libcurl would pretty much remain mandatory, or strongly recommended.
